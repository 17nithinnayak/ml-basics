# ML-Basics

Welcome to **ml-basics**, a repository where I implement core Machine Learning algorithms from the ground up using Python — with **no high-level libraries** like Scikit-learn. This repo also includes clear notes and concise explanations on **ML foundational concepts**, meant to build strong mathematical and theoretical intuition.

> This is part of my learning journey towards mastering machine learning fundamentals — especially important for interview prep and entrance tests, research roles, or competitive ML settings.

## 🚀 What's in this Repository?

### ✅ Implementations from Scratch
Algorithms coded purely from first principles using Python and NumPy:
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Decision Trees
- [x] Random Forests
- [ ] Support Vector Machines (coming soon)
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [x] PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] K-Nearest Neighbors
- [ ] Gradient Descent (Custom for models)
- [ ] XGBoost (Manual version planned)

Each implementation is:
---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen foundational ML knowledge
- Be able to explain **every line** of model code
- Prepare for **research**, **interviews**, and **exams**
- Build a **clean, reference-ready repo** for future use

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python (3.10+)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 💡 Future Plans
- Add hyperparameter tuning from scratch
- Include experiments comparing custom vs sklearn models
- Create visual explanations for algorithms
- Build basic ML pipelines
